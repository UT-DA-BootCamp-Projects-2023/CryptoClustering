# CryptoClustering _ Module19_Challenge

## Challenge Overview
--

In this challenge, using the knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning need to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. In order predict below detailed activities were performed<br>
* Preparing the data
* Finding the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled Data Frame
* Clustering Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data
* Optimizing Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
* Finding the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
* Clustering Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
* Finally, Visualizing and comparing the Results

**-- Content in Main Branch --**

3. README.md

**-- Execute the Crypto_Clustering.ipynb --**
1. Open the Jyupter notebook using visual studio code.
2. Select the correct python environment
3. Click Run all or run each cell in sequence. Please note - running cells in-between or skipping any cell execution might result in error as the variables defined in prior cell might be used. Please run in sequence only.
